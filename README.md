A mod providing useful things for Hypixel Skyblock.
Discontinued by prplz and picked up again by Kittnt.

Planned Features:
-
- Anvil uses in tooltip
- Item IDs in tooltip
- Item tiers as stack size
- Logo in containers
- Custom main menu

I would not recommend trying to compile this yourself before the first release.
